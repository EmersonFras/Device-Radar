# Device Radar

## What is this?
Currently it doesn't do much *(as of 06/8/2025)*! Read [Version Details](#version-details) to see current functionality.
## What is it going to do?
Great question! As development continues this will be a network device radar to find devices on the same network as the one your computer is connected to. There are similar services existing that do this same thing but this is just made for a fun personal learning experience along with some practical customization that is planned for when the main functionality exists. Since this is in development there isn't much more to add, right now the service is being developed to ping all the devices and later the frontend will be developed.

Thanks for following along and keep hacking!
